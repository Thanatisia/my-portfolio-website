			<h3 style="padding-right:1%;">
				<!-- Hello everyone! first of all, thank you for visiting my portfolio site. It is still a work-in-progress so it still looks really unpolished and is effectively still just a draft - but nonetheless, I appreciate you for taking a look. <br/>
				Next, just a self-introduction: I go by the codenames 'Thanatisia' and/or 'Asura' for the time being. <br/>
				I love Programming (Mobile | Web Development | Desktop Applications and the likes) and Info(Cyber)Security and have had multiple years of experience in the aforementioned areas. <br/>
				I tend to program even on my free time after work or after school, so that says alot about my life :^). <br/>
				Jokes aside, I love to also read about the latest infosec news alongside Linux and also do rice my builds from time to time. <br/>
				Finally, thank you for reading up to this point and please feel free to provide any feedback on how I can improve my site or in any other manner, Thank you! -->
