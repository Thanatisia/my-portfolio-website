			<h3>
				Hello everyone! first of all, thank you for visiting my portfolio site. It is still a work-in-progress so it still looks really unpolished and is effectively still just a draft - but nonetheless, I appreciate you for taking a look. <br/>
				Next, just a self-introduction: I go by the codenames 'Thanatisia' and/or 'Asura' for the time being. <br/>
				I love Programming (Mobile | Web Development | Desktop Applications and the likes) and Info(Cyber)Security and have had multiple years of experience in the aforementioned areas. <br/>
				I tend to program even on my free time after work or after school, so that says alot about my life :^). <br/>
				Jokes aside, I love to also read about the latest infosec news alongside Linux and also do rice my builds from time to time. <br/>
				Finally, thank you for reading up to this point and please feel free to provide any feedback on how I can improve my site or in any other manner, Thank you!

				<h3>These are some of my recommended/current projects</h3>
				<li>
					<a href="https://github.com/Thanatisia/SharedSpace">SharedSpace</a> | This project aims to hold documentations, projects and codes regarding various things such as (but not limited to) <br/>
					1. Linux (installation guides, documentations, steps, installation scripts) <br/>
					2. Programming/Web Development Language guides <br/>
					3. Snippets <br/>
					4. Dotfiles <br/>
					5. Configs <br/>
					- An example of what I recommend with regards to this repository are my Linux install-scripts, such as my <br/>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4> 
								1. ArchLinux Install Scripts <br/>
								<div id="installscript-intro">
									<h4 class="headers">Introduction</h4>
									I created this install script with the following basic principles in mind:
									<ul>
										<li>Modular</li>
										<li>Portable</li>
										<li>Reusable</li>
									</ul>
									The primary purpose was so that I can create a linux profile where I can bring around and have the convenience of reinstalling the linux distro whenever required with the same specifications, everytime - with as little keystrokes as possible. <br/>
									This first started with ArchLinux, thus currently I only have a ArchLinux install script - however, i made documentation, step-by-step installation guides for <b>Debian via Debootstrap (referenced from the debootstrap docs)</b> and <b>Void Linux via chroot (referenced from the void linux chroot docs)</b>. <br/>
								</div>

								<hr/>
								
								<div id="installscript-manual">
									<h4 class="headers">How to use?</h4>
									1. Before Executing <br/>
									1.1. Open up the script <br/>
									1.2. Change the variables <br/>
									1.2.1. Populate base-installation details such as
									<ul>
										<li>Device Details (Device name '/dev/sdX', Partitions etc.)</li>
										<li>System Details</li>
										<li>User Details</li>
										<li>Basic Profile Information</li>
										<li>Packages to install on base-install</li>
									</ul>
									1.3. Backup the script (OPTIONAL) <br/>
									1.4. Ensure you have arch-chroot <br/>
									<ul>
										<li>Currently - as of 2021-10-01 1422H - this utilizes arch-chroot;</li>
										<li>thus you will require a arch-based distro or install arch-chroot)</li>
										<li>I recommend using this with the latest release of the arch installer, use wget to download the script</li>
									</ul>
									2. Execute script and let it load <br/>
									3. Done <br/>
									<br/>
									You do not need to change the functions (unless the purpose is to modify it).
									Now you can just bring this script to the next computer, rinse and repeat steps [1.4-3].<br/>
									You can even place this on a shared drive and run it simultaneously on multiple computers with the same build! (please help me test that, at the moment I only had a test case of 5 VMs :^V, thank you!)
								</div>

								<hr/>

								<div id="installscript-files">
									<h4 class="headers">Files in installscript folders</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>
											installer-manual.sh
											<p>
												This is the original version of the ArchLinux install script as well as the original vision. <br/>
												This version requires the user to modify the Associative Arrays, you do not need to touch the functions (unless the purpose is to modify). <br/>
												All you need to do is scroll down through the Associative Arrays, populate them and thats it, you can just backup and run. <br/>
											</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											installer-ux.min.sh
											<p>
												This is my "Minimal" form of the ArchLinux install script. <br/>
												With this version, I have made a set of variables on top that corresponds with the associative arrays below (linked to the functions). <br/>
												Thus, with this version, you can just edit everything under "EDIT THIS" without touching the associative arrays, back it up and run it, as opposed to installer-manual.sh which uses the Associative Arrays instead.
											</p>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</div>

								<div id="installscript-variations">
									Variations:<br/>
									<div id="archinstallscript-template">
										<a href="https://github.com/Thanatisia/SharedSpace/tree/main/Linux/dotfiles/distros/ArchLinux/profiles/Reference_Profile-1/install-scripts">ArchLinux Installscript Template</a> | This is the template variation - Each variable and/or Associative Arrays are labelled with the default/recommended values and what kind of value should go into it. <br/>
										Optional and Required variable fields are also marked out to make usability better.
									</div>
									<div id="archinstallscript-prebuilt">
										<a href="https://github.com/Thanatisia/SharedSpace/tree/main/Linux/dotfiles/distros/ArchLinux/profiles/VBox_USBoot-1/install-scripts">ArchLinux Installscript Pre-Built Design</a> | This is the prebuilt variation - This has been predesigned with one of my builds in mind and has been tested to be stable (on my VM). <br/>
										With this, you can look through the variables and recreate the requirements and test it out before using the template and/or modifying this to fit your requirements.
